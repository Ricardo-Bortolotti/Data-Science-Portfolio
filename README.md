# Data Science Portfolio

#### Welcome to my Data Science / Machine Learning portfolio!

Hello! I am Ricardo Bortolotti, Ph.D. in Mathematics, in a career transition to Data Science / Machine Learning. My passion lies in Machine Learning, Statistics and Mathematics, and I am constantly developing projects in these areas. See them below!

## Projects

### Clustering

#### [Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning algorithms K-means and PCA (Python)](https://github.com/Ricardo-Bortolotti/Customer-segmentation/tree/main)

- Description: In this project, I performed an unsupervised learning clustering task using K-Means and dimensionaly reduction with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to segment customers of a retail store, splitting them into groups with similar feature among members.

- Business problem: A retail store wants to understand more deeply the characteristics of its customers and strategically use this information to increase the number of sales and revenue. For this, they want to segment the customers into profiles according to preferences, spending patterns and personal information.

- Results: I divided the clients into 5 groups, profiling them according to similar behavior as customers. I provided business insights to better understand their clients and recommendations for promotions to increase the number of sales.
