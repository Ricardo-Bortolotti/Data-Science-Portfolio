# Data Science Portfolio

#### Welcome to my Data Science / Machine Learning portfolio!

Hello! I am Ricardo Bortolotti, Ph.D. in Mathematics, in a career transition to Data Science / Machine Learning. My passion lies in Machine Learning, Statistics and Mathematics, and I am constantly developing projects in these areas. See them below!

# Projects

## Clustering

### 1- [Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning algorithms K-means and PCA (Python)](https://github.com/Ricardo-Bortolotti/Customer-segmentation/tree/main)

- Description: In this project, I performed an unsupervised Machine Learning clustering task using K-Means and dimensionality reduction with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to segment customers of a retail store, splitting them into groups with similar features among members.

- Business problem: A retail store wants to understand more deeply the characteristics of its customers and strategically use this information to increase the number of sales and revenue. For this, they want to segment the customers into profiles according to preferences, spending patterns and personal information.

- Results: I divided the clients into 5 groups, profiling them according to similar behavior as customers. I provided business insights to better understand their clients and recommendations for promotions to increase the number of sales.


## Regression

### 2- [Prediction of House Prices](https://github.com/Ricardo-Bortolotti/Regression-house-prices/tree/main)

- Description: In this project, I performed a supervised Machine Learning task of prediction using several algorithms of Regression, which allowed us to obtain a good model that predicts the Price of a house based in its features. 

- Business problem: A real estate store wants to have a computational model that predicts the price of houses based on the information about its Area, number of Rooms, Address, if it has Parking, Elevator and Warehouse. This model allows us to understand better the characteristics that influence the prices in that city and to strategically use this information to review their prices.

- Results: We performed an exploratory data analysis of the prices in that city, which gives a better understanding of what influences the Price, and we developed a Model of Regression that predicts the price of the house. The algorithm of regression with the best performance was Random Forest after tuning hyper-parameters with GridSearchCv.


## Classification

### 3- [Prediction of Breast Cancer](https://github.com/Ricardo-Bortolotti/Breast-cancer-prediction/tree/main)

- Description: In this project, I performed a supervised Machine Learning task of Classification using several algorithms of classification, which allowed us to obtain a good model that predicts of a digitalized image of breast mass corresponding to cancer. 

- Business problem: A hospital wants to have a computational model that detects if a digitalized image of a breath mass is cancer or not, this model will be a helpful tool for the doctors to make their diagnostics.

- Results: We developed a Model of Classification that predicts whether a breast mass is cancer (malignant) or not (benign). The algorithm of classification with the best performance was Light GBM.
